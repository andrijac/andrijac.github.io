If you:

- Have only watched Star Wars movies
- Never read anything about Star Wars Expanded Universe
- Never read a Darth Bane story
- Love Star Wars

This article is for you. <br />
I am going to try my best not to spoil the story.

Darth Bane was the one how reformed Sith order and made a Rule of Two, rule by which all Sith lords have lived afterwards for thousand years up to Darth Sidious and Darth Vader.
As one who watched only Star Wars movies, I found a lot of new and interesting things about Star Wars universe that I wanted to share with you.

(Note who wrote Darth Bane books and links and cover pictures)


## Force

###Enhanced abilities
There is such thing as speed of the force. Force user (Sith or Jedi) can move so fast that untrained eye cannot even see what are they doing. As we know from movies, force can enhance ones abilities like jumping higher or softer landings from heights.<br />
Also, force can be used to endure longer without food and water by draining the power of the force. Jedi can heal them self's with force. <br />
Force user can make "cocoon" around them to protect themselves from sometimes hostile environment (e.g. moving briefly through Space) or environmental conditions that physical body cannot endure (e.g. falling from great heights in water).

###Magic
You can say that Force is sort of magic. 
Sith have ability to perform group rituals to summon huge amounts of Force power and direct it where they want.<br />
Also, there is Sith sorcery, which can be controlled by individual and if the foe is not protected or prepared properly for such attack, Sith that released the sorcery with inevitably prevail.

###Area of Effect

**Battle mediation** is a way to affect the mood, motivation, emotions and most importantly to direct ones will one desired direction. <br />
Something like what Obi-Wan did to Stormtroopers in Episode IV: *"These aren't the droids you're looking for"* just one much larger scale for example affecting whole friendly or enemy army by boosting their morale or by putting the fear in enemy hearts, respectively. [Ithorians](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ithorian) were specially talented in this skill. <br />
This means that is not so much important how much army you have. In war, battle between Jedi and Sith determinants faith of all.


##Jedi code/mantra
Jedi code is also used by Jedi as mantra to return them to their "path" and to calm them down.
This is not complete Jedi code, these sentences are the parts of the code that were used by Jedi in book:<br />
*There is no emotion, there is peace.*<br />
*There is no death, there is the Force.*

##Sith code
*Peace is a lie, there is only passion.*<br />
*Through passion, I gain strength.*<br />
*Through strength, I gain power.*<br />
*Through power, I gain victory.*<br />
*Through victory, my chains are broken.*
